# pcb-spartan-3
First attempt at PCB design using KiCad 5.1. This design contains Xilinx Spartan-3 programmable either through JTAG or Atmega328p.

Eeschema produces some warnings, due to the fact I have used different grids, which I learned later to be discouraged.

In the library, there are more footprints/models than actually used. I did not remove the unused ones.

Tested only on Windows 10.
